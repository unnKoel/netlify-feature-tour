## For project already existing
- ðŸ“š [Get started with Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/)

  key takeaways as follows
  1. Authentication
      
      run command `netlify login`
  2. Continuous deployment
      
      run command `netlify init` or `netlify init --manual` which leave you to manually add the key and webhook URL to your Git provider, those inforamation is offered by Netlify CLI
  3. Get started with Netlify Dev

      > `Netlify Dev` brings the functionality of your Netlify production environment directly to your local machine. It provides a proxy server that includes edge logic for custom headers and redirects, environment variables, and Netlify Functions.

      run command `netlify dev` or `netlify dev --context production`

  4. Run build locally
  5. Manual deployment
  6. Manage environment variables

      Use the --context and --scope flags with your CLI commands to set contextual or scope values

#### Configuration information
Netlify CLI will look for this information in three places, in the following order:

- in flags specified in the command itself.
- in a netlify.toml file stored at the root of your project directory.
- in your site configuration in the Netlify UI, if continuous deployment is set up for the site.

About how Netlify configure, please take a look at below diagram
